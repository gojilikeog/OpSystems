# CSC415-Assignment-1
Assignment 1 – Command Line Arguments
Welcome to your First homework assignment.  

Let me remind you of the expectations. Code should be neat, well documented. Comments should describe the logic not repeat the code.  Variables should have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent. In addition, each file should have a standard header as defined below. (Keep lines to around 80 characters per line, and not line greater than 100 characters).

All filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`, except Makefile.

In addition, each file must have a standard header as defined below.  Make sure to put in your section number (replace the #), your name, your student ID, a proper project name, GitHub name, filename, and description of the project.

```

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.  You can (and should) work in groups to research how to do the assignment, but each person should code their own version and make their own submission.

This program is to demonstrate the usage of command line arguments in a C program.  You will write this to run in the Linux virtual machine.  The program should display the number of arguments from the command line and list each one on the console. 

Here is a sample execution:
 
```
student:~/CSC415$ make run RUNOPTIONS="Hello, these are overridden options 3 6 9"
gcc -c -o bierman_robert_hw1_main.o bierman_robert_hw1_main.c -g -I. 
gcc -o bierman_robert_hw1_main bierman_robert_hw1_main.o -g -I.  
./bierman_robert_hw1_main Hello, these are overridden options 3 6 9

There were 9 arguments on the command line.
Argument 00: 	./bierman_robert_hw1_main
Argument 01: 	Hello,
Argument 02: 	these
Argument 03: 	are
Argument 04: 	overridden
Argument 05: 	options
Argument 06: 	3
Argument 07: 	6
Argument 08: 	9
student:~/CSC415$
```

You should submit your source code file(s), Makefile along with a writeup (use the provided template) in PDF format into your GIT repository and submit the PDF into the assignment in Canvas.  Your write-up should include a description of the project and what you did, issues you had, how you overcame the issues and the compilation and execution output from your program (screen shots embedded in the PDF document. Your execution output should include commands with the command-line arguments.  

All filenames should be `<lastname>_<firstname>_HW<#>_<component>.<proper extension>`
So my filename would be `Bierman_Robert_HW1_main.c`

You would modify the Makefile by entering your Lastname and Firstname (note no spaces).  Do not alter anything else in the Makefile.

```
# File: Makefile

LASTNAME=Bierman
FIRSTNAME=Robert
HW=1

RUNOPTIONS=Hello World


ROOTNAME=$(LASTNAME)_$(FIRSTNAME)_HW
FOPTION=_main
CC=gcc
CFLAGS= -g -I.
# To add libraries, add "-l <libname>", for multiple repeat prior for each lib.
LIBS =
DEPS = 
OBJ = $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION).o

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

$(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION): $(OBJ)
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS)  $(LIBS)

clean:
	rm *.o $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION)

run: $(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION)
	./$(ROOTNAME)$(HW)$(FOPTION) $(RUNOPTIONS)
```
